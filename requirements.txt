# Note: Most dependencies are installed automatically when ACE-Step is installed
# via `uv pip install .` in the Dockerfile. This file only lists additional
# packages not included in ACE-Step's pyproject.toml.

# fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic, scipy, soundfile, einops, huggingface-hub, etc.

# No additional packages required - ACE-Step handles all dependencies
